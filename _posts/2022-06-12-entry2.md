Quick update today. Since last Tuesday the focus has entirely been on development. Multiplayer was the most important feature to add because a lot of the code layout depends on this. Multiplayer support has been added successfully. The game logic is now handled by the back end application. The front end (aka Unity project) has been tested in the browser to make sure it can connect to the back end and everything works end-to-end. A basic version of a lobby where players can create or join existing games has been built for the front and back end applications. Next is cleaning up and refactoring code where necessary and fixing any bugs that come up. By end of next week the goal is to have a publicly available and playable version online. Then comes playtesting, balancing and adding more features. This way we can have a soft launch where we make sure everything works before any "official release" (by making a "Show HN" post for example).
