Looking back at the progress I am very happy with what has been accomplished so far. But, in the last few days I've found myself in the "Just need a little bit more before I can show it to anyone" trap and it starts getting discouraging because there's always just a little bit more that can be added, improved or fixed. So it's time to stop that and get it public ASAP:

1. Get a short Gif and video of the current state of the game
2. Set up a discord with some basic channels, showing the video footage
3. ~~Spam~~ Post the Gif + link to Discord on other Discords and Reddit

I am taking a break until Saturday though and can then continue on this.

After that, the plan is to get the game to an MVP state where it's reasonable to let the people from the Discord play it:
1. Clean up the UI and website a little bit
2. Small FPS fixes
3. Create a quick four player map

Then we can announce on Discord that they can play the early version.
